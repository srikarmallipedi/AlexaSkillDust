This project was a culmination of my recently attained computer science skills in my AP Computer Science Class. 
It was inspired by Krishnaraj's project which can be found here:https://www.hackster.io/krvarma/particle-alexa-5bc196
The code in mine is modified from his so that I could get the desired behaviour. 
The purpose of this project was to help people who are sensitive to air quality. 
The Particle Photon reads the density of the dust in the room and relays that information to the Echo through the cloud.

From there, the value read is compared to a value recommended by specialists and Alexa lets the user know whether it is safe to stay in the room or advisable to leave. 
All of this voice controlled and handled with AWS Lambda.
